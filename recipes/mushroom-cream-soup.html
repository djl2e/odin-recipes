    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This mushroom cream soup is so delicious, that it is a perfect dish
        by itself, but also compliments all other dishes so well. As my personal
        favorite soup, I hope this recipe makes you love this soup as much as I do!
        The onion caramelization and the touch of thyme is key to this recipe.

            Reduce heat to low and continue to cook until mushrooms turn golden brown.

            onion turns soft and translucent.
