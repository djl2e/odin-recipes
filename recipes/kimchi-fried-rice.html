            Heat 1 Tb of canola oil in pan over high heat. Add the pork and the
            white parts of green onion into the pan. Cook until meat is brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Push the meat and green onion to one side of the pan and add the
            soy sauce to the other side so that the sauce touches nothing but the pan.
            Once the soy sauce simmers, add the kimchi and mix all the ingredients together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the kimchi juice reduces a bit, add the cooked rice and stir
            until the rice is fully coated with the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            On a separate pan, heat 1Tb of canola oil over medium high. Crack egg
            into the pan and cook until yolk is thick. Place egg over fried rice.
