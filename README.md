# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes is my first mini project using HTML! 
On my homepage, I added a list of links to recipes of 3 dishes I love: tomato basil pasta, kimchi fried rice, and mushroom cream soup.
Through working on this project, I have found a better understanding of how to
add headers of different size, links (especially of pages in same site), images, paragraphs, and unordered and ordered lists.
I am excited to learn about CSS and JS through TOP to make my website more aesthetically pleasing!
